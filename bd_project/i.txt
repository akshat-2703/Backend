          b. how to get data coming from frontend at backend route
//frontend basically our ejs
//ejs basically same like html par aap uske andr calculation kr skte ho dynamic stuff likh skte ho frontend basically our ejs h 
as like u write in html file as <h1>2+2</h1> 
as in html was tough that to calculate ejs as u write as <h1>2+2</h1> aur aap usko bta doge k apko ejs m  likhana h then it will very easy manner calculate it 
ejs html exact duplicate jesa hi hota but ejs have some specific power jo ki aap perform kr ste html k andr
install ejs from npm 
setup ejs  as a middleware for view engine

//FOR Dynamic part writing in ejs as basically we write as <%= expression %>

//setting up public static files 
public static files are basically usually refers to use css,images,vannilla javascript 
jo frontend p lgti h
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname,'public'))) ;
//as this line basically refer as sari static files like (images,videos,stylesheet,javascript) in sbko dhundhne  k liye kha jana h public folder m 
console.log(__dirname+'/public') it basically shows the path upto the public folder or it shows the path
as path.join() also do the same that upto the path but for that we have to write const path = require('path') ;
//as u already write or done the ejs so for writing stylesheet style.css directly dont have to mention public folder in it
//as ejs pages m aapko public ka naam ni likhana h
